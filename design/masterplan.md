# CanvasLytics ‚Äî Masterplan.md

## üß≠ Overview & Objective

**CanvasLytics** is a web-based, Excalidraw-style data exploration canvas that allows data scientists to interact with and model their datasets using visual elements and natural language commands. It aims to streamline the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and baseline machine learning workflow through a multimodal interface ‚Äî combining charts, wizards, and an intelligent NL assistant.

The objective is to accelerate data understanding and experimentation without requiring users to write code, while preserving the control and flexibility expected by experienced data practitioners.

  - Dataset summary: column schema, missing values, distribution
  - Prompt suggestions from AI assistant

- **ML Modeling Wizard**:
  - Tasks: Classification, Regression, Clustering
  - Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Linear Regression, KMeans, etc.
  - Output: Accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC, R¬≤, feature importance
  - Artifacts: Downloadable pipeline code and pickle model

- **Natural Language Interaction**:
  - ‚ÄúTrain a random forest to predict survival‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúShow me age distribution by gender‚Äù
  - Integrated AI assistant suggesting top queries

- **Canvas Export & Sharing**:
  - Export board as visual summary or code/model artifacts
  - Public sharing via URL (editable via duplication)

|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Frontend       | React, Next.js, Excalidraw | SPA with interactive canvas             |
| Backend Agent  | Python, WebSockets       | Handles chat, tool routing              |
| EDA Service    | Pandas, Seaborn          | Generates visualizations                |
| ML Service     | Scikit-learn             | Trains and evaluates models             |

## üóÉÔ∏è Conceptual Data Model

- **Canvas**: Includes references to datasets, charts, models
- **Dataset**: ID, name, schema, in-memory file
- **Chart Block**: Type, data source, rendered metadata
- **Model Block**: Task type, model type, metrics, downloadable output
- **Chat Log**: NL prompt history (session only)

---

## üé® UI/UX Design Principles

- **Zero-friction onboarding**: No login, immediate interaction
- **Multimodal control**: Buttons, drag-and-drop, right-click, and NL input
- **Visual-first**: All analysis and modeling reflected as cards on canvas
- **Responsiveness**: Zoom, pan, rearrange elements fluidly
- **Reusability**: Shareable canvases act as both workspace and report

---

## üîê Security & Privacy Considerations

- Anonymous usage only (no login or user tracking)
- Shared boards are editable via duplication
- No user code execution (only internal scikit-learn/pandas toolchains)
- In-memory processing only (no long-term dataset storage)

---

## üö¶Development Phases

**Phase 1: Core MVP**
- Upload dataset (CSV/JSON/Parquet)
- Auto-generated EDA cards
- NL prompt assistant
- ML pipeline wizard (baseline models)
- Canvas drag/drop + export

**Phase 2: Share & Enhance**
- Public board sharing + duplication
- Artifact download (charts, pickle, code)
- Expanded chart options

**Phase 3: Power Features**
- Hyperparameter tuning (via UI sliders)
- Dataset versioning or diffing
- Multi-dataset linking and merging

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                         | Suggested Solution                                      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Large files affecting performance| 100MB cap, stream uploads, paginate previews            |
| Natural language ambiguity       | Guided NL prompts + contextual hints                    |
| Memory usage in multi-user mode  | Implement per-session cleanup, idle timeouts            |
| Canvas complexity as boards grow | Zoom-level filtering, card minimization, search/filter |
